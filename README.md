# Tetrify (ARES HackTX Project)
 
A project aimed at making Tetris more accessible by leveraging computer vision, specifically media
pipe. Players can control the movement of the blocks using hand position rather than precise
keyboard inputs. 

Original Tetris code forked from ibrahimAtespare. Check it out here: https://github.com/ibrahimAtespare/tetris-python

Made for HackTX 2024.

## Directions for use
`pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame`

`python3 tetris2.py`

## Personal Contribution
( I worked in VS Code Live Share, so my contributions aren't credited in the commits :P )

Primarily collaborated to develop the interaction with the MediaPipe Solutions API in Python, working to preprocess the most important hand landmarks, calibrate the positioning, and control the logic of gameplay based on perceived movement.
